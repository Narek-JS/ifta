We can help you keep the records you need and file accurate IFTA returns quickly every three months.Of course, you need to keep detailed records of your activities while on the road.</p> <p> In order to accurately file your IFTA returns, you need to log the date of your trips, your routes, your mileage (subdivided into mileage within each jurisdiction), and any intermediate stops you made along the way. When combined with your fuel receipts (you need to keep these too), the IFTA will be able to recreate your drives well enough to separate your fuel tax revenue accurately.</p>",
